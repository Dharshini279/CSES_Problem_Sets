📌 **Problem:** Minimum Subset Sum Difference  
🔗 **Link:** *(Add your problem link here if available)*

---

### 🧠 Approach:
- Calculate the total sum `t` of all array elements.
- Try all possible subsets using combinations.
- For each subset:
  - Let its sum be `s1`.
  - The other subset sum = `t - s1`.
  - Update the minimum difference as `abs(t - 2 * s1)`.

---

### ⚠️ Edge Cases:
- Single element → one subset is empty.
- Empty array → return 0.
- Large arrays → very slow (brute-force).

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity:
- **Time:** O(2ⁿ × n)
- **Space:** O(1) (extra)
